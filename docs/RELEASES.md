# Releases (Readable and Human)

## Overview

This is the repo’s **trailer**, not its police report.

Most release notes read like a change request got hit by a tranquilizer dart: technically correct, emotionally dead. This file is for PMs who want the punchline fast: what new power you just got, what changed under your feet, and which links to click when you want the details, examples, and the “how we made the sausage” backstory.

If you’re wondering any of these:
- “What can I do now that I couldn’t do last version?”
- “Did we finally ship the thing I care about?”
- “Why does this behave differently than last week?”
- “What should I read before I start messing with knobs?”

You’re in the right place.
