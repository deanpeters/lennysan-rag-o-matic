# Prompts v0.5 Log

Approximate chronological list of user prompts from the v0.5 session.

```
read index_corpus.py and explore.py and I think you'll see you're off-base with your plan.
```

```
read /deannotes/available-models.md to learn more about the available models.
```

```
if we type in pythong explore.py --model --help, can we get a listing ... or some similar convention?
```

```
let's add `--list-models` as future iterations are going to be extended to both cloud-baed and local models.
```

```
we should test first, then document, don't you think?
```

```
this is my first time working with you, let's ee how you do with option 1.
```

```
technically it works, but the outcomes for OpenAI suck when compared to Anthropic.
```

```
I think both improvements are called for, let's do it.
```

```
I like this 3 part structure, as this is primarily a pedagogic tool, and secondarily a research tool.
```

```
yes
```

```
also, there's a lot of warnings noise on sceen, any chance of supressing them?
```

```
crap, now GPT-4o isn't finding direct, it was just before this fix. and gpt-4o-mini also now not finding direct. Feels like we regressed badly.
```

```
nope, nope, nope ... 4o, 4o-mini, Sonnet ... only haiku works
```

```
there ya go. let's update our .md and release notes, etc. in the release notes, you need to mention the issues we had with getting these prompts just right.
```

```
we should move `RELEASE_v0.1.md` and `RELEASE_v0.5.md` into a subdir named `releasenotes` -- then do option 1 about updating cost expectations in README.md -- then do option 2, adding "Troubleshooting model switching" section
```

```
yes, definately update the link refrences -- good catch -- thanks for being proactive
```

```
Hey, went to run the test manually. activate.sh has some undesired behvior. basically I run the command, but then it doesn't leave us in the virtual environment. so of course none of the python commands work.
```

```
that dumped me straight out of my termal, here's a capture:

```
any need to update requirements.txt or AGENTS.md ?
```

```
did you notice in /deannotes/SESSION.0.1.STORY.md I tell the story of the session almost as a blow-by-blow timeline, supplying my own quotes verbatim, giving commentary and tips? I ask as I wonder if you feel you could do the same for a SESSION.0.5.STORY.md ... so Weekend at Lenny's part 2
```

```
I want the entire sessions saga, and I want the tone playful and candid. Imagine if humorist Dave Barry channeling Lundrake and DHH
```

```
We started at 4:15 PM, it's now 6:00 PM, let's approximate time stamps. also, don't use markdown quotes for my prompts, use markdown code blocks. use the triple backticks for the code block, any embedded code, use the triple ~ char. Also, you really didn't tell a story. We should mentioned that "Embittered by the Ravens fall-apart-season, and spared that my Pittburgh-born Steelers were out of the picture, I opted to play with models rather than see the Bills play the Broncos. Especailly since the latter is my older borther's favorite team. (no, I'm not jealous, but why does his team get to win my team and my wife's don't?) ... clearly the fix is in but I digress ..."  and with each prompt, let's be more vivid, visual, even visceral with our language. You are playing it waaaay to safe. We are writing for not-so-technical PMs, not grumpy old programmers.
```

```
This is a teaching document, of course I want that level of detail.
```

```
this is very weak tea. Yes, I want even more, even more, more more. I'd rather have too much and have to shave it down.
```

```
can we perhaps just enumerate my prompts for this session into a prompts v.05  log in deannotes? is that possible?
```
