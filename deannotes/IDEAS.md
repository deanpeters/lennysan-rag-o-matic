# IDEAS.md (Parking Lot, Not a Commitment)

This file is where ideas go when they are real but not yet on the roadmap.
If it is on the roadmap, it does not belong here anymore.

The rule is simple:
- **Unslated ideas** have no tag.
- **Slated ideas** get a parenthetical tag like `(slated v0.85)`.

Think of it like a Sneetch list:
- No star = interesting, but not scheduled.
- Star (version tag) = scheduled, now it belongs on the roadmap too.

## Format

- Short idea statement
- Optional one‑line why it matters
- Optional tag if scheduled

## Examples

- Add a “brevity vs verbose” response mode for cheaper smoke tests. (slated v1.35)
- Add a “Lenny therapy” facilitation mode to help PMs reflect.
- Add an export option for Markdown or DOCX.
- Add model aliases (e.g., `sonnet` -> `sonnet-4`) for easier CLI typing.
